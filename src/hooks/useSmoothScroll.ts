/**
 * Eased wheel scrolling.
 *
 * The native wheel step is abrupt, which made the pinned sections feel twitchy
 * and hard to land on. This intercepts wheel input and eases the page toward a
 * target offset instead of jumping to it.
 *
 * Deliberate constraints, because smooth-scroll implementations are a classic
 * source of the exact bugs we are trying to avoid:
 *
 * - Wheel only. Keyboard, scrollbar dragging, anchor jumps, find-in-page and
 *   touch are all left completely alone, so nothing can be trapped.
 * - The target re-syncs to the real scroll position whenever the page moves by
 *   any other means, so it can never fight the browser or strand the user.
 * - It disables itself for coarse pointers and for prefers-reduced-motion.
 * - The rAF loop stops the moment it arrives; it never idles.
 * - Bounded per-event delta, so a trackpad fling or a "scroll to bottom"
 *   gesture cannot overshoot into a long uninterruptible glide.
 * - The pending glide can never run more than ~0.85 screens ahead of the
 *   current position. Without that cap, a hard inertial fling accumulates a
 *   target screens ahead and warps straight through pinned sections
 *   (What I Do) in fast-forward — the exact "it never stops me" failure.
